### About

Textile allows you to edit the texts of Figma layouts separately from Figma. In Google Sheets. 

### Usage

- Translate prototypes into other languages;
- Don't think about whether the author knows how to work in Figma or not;
- Give access to texts only;
- Focus on words and sentences;
- Change texts in layouts quickly and easily;
- Schedule UX Writers' Work;
- Don't pay for Figma license for authors;

### Quickstart

1. Pick Textile from the [Figma Plugin Page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1334130766673706263/textile). 
2. Make your own copy of the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fpin_ZbIDcfHaKbJ8hDL7raARSsBeSf22Drby1jUaak/edit#gid=941219228). 
3. Install everything according to the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bycZAlmCtTRd1lwokXU2FtjB-AYmKymaCTx1GvNa53o/edit#heading=h.knr02d98kcq2).
4. Run plugin. 

### Pre-requisites

To use this plugin, you will need to have a Google account and a permission to edit a Figma file (if you are not an owner). The “view only” mode will not allow the plugin to upload text. If you do not have access to the file, then ask the file owner to upload the text for you using the plugin or make a personal copy of the file.
